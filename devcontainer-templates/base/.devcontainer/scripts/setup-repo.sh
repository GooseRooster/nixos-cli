# devcontainers/features/common-utils:2 has a regression where it creates
# (or recreates) ~/.local and ~/.config as root-owned after install, which
# breaks anything that subsequently tries to mkdir under them -- notably
# Home Manager / nix (mkdir under ~/.config / ~/.local),
# cargo, and any tool that lazy-creates XDG dirs. The fix has to run here in
# post-create: the Feature runs between the Dockerfile and us, so a Dockerfile
# chown would just be clobbered. Idempotent; ignores paths that don't exist yet.
